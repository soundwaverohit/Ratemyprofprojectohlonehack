      "Midterm caught everyone by surprise but his final was easier. He offers plenty of resources to practice and learn the concepts. His lectures are very engaging and applicable to the real world!\n",
      "Super fun lecturer. Absolutely must do practice problems to succeed on exams, which compromise the majority of your grade. One midterm, one final, some homework and some quizzes. If you do the practice problems from the book and assigned homework, you should have no problem with the tests, otherwise be prepared to fail. Nonetheless a fantastic prof\n",
      "Wonderful teacher to learn physics Great lecture presenter, clearly explains concepts PLEASE TAKE NOTES IN CLASS\n",
      "Excellent physics prof, really knows what he's doing and is super enthusiastic about the subject material. If he taught upper div classes, I would not hesitate to take him, but beware that if you're gonna rely on the curve for Physics 7E, don't take his class--it's only about 1-2% over your raw grade for your \"curved\" grade.\n",
      "I had Professor Guerra for Physics 7C and 7E, and all I can say is that he is hands down the best if not, one of the best physics professors at UCI! Hes very enthusiastic/clear about what he teaches, and his exams are fair game. In order to do well, I recommend doing the suggested homework AND mastering physics homework.\n",
      "He's a good professor. He's fun, passionate, and good at teaching. His tests are a little tricky, but it seems like they are just the \"extra examples\" he has on his website. Do those and you'll do fine.\n",
      "I had a fever on the day of midterm, so I made up the exam. However, the make-up one was much harder than the original one and there was even one problem that both of the TAs could not solve. He thinks it is fair to give a harder make-up that even 2 TAs(grad students) cannot get 100%. class average is 44/60 and 20+/60 for the make up one.\n",
      "Best physics professor I've had and one of the best professors at UCI. His lectures are clear, helpful, and concise. Does a lot of practice problems that are similar to the questions on the midterm and final exams. Cares a lot for students. Go over homework and in-class examples to do well on exams (very exam heavy class - midterm 35%, final 45%).\n",
      "I got a B- in his 7C but an A+ in 7D and all full scores on midterm, final and quizzes. The only thing that I want to say about doing well in his class is GO TO LECTURES. Because he will put the nearly same problems that he talked about in class on midterm and final. You need to know everything that he taught in class, especially those hard ones.\n",
      "Really good prof, he talks really fast but its only because he's so passionate about the subject and because he gets really excited. Definitely wouldn't mind taking him again, just he is very strict on grading criteria so remember that.\n",
      "Prof. Guerra is one of those truly good profs. He knows what he's teaching and doesn't just read off of powerpoint slides. During lectures, he goes through many examples so highly suggest you don't skip class. Although his tests consist of 4 to 5 problems, he told us which specific concepts will be tested so in the end it's all fair game.\n",
      "Prof. Guerra is an amazing lecturer, which makes all the difference for Physics classes! He has a high standard for his students but doesn't throw curveballs. Expect difficult, but doable problems. He grades on the department curve, which is to be expected for most Physics classes.\n",
      "This professor is the reason I am getting my bachelors in Electrical Engineering. He made me so interested in electricity and magnetism, which led me to pursue a specialization in circuit design. His passion for the subject is what inspired me to become an engineer.\n",
      "He did a good job explaining new concepts and formula and stuff like that and his lectures were filled with passion.\n",
      "Professor Guerra is one of the best professors I have ever had. He makes the class interesting while also still clearly explaining the physics concepts. Showing up to class benefits you because he talks about the exact problems that will be on the quizzes, midterm, and final. I am taking again next quarter!\n",
      "Prof Guerra is a nice guy but his tests are consisted with only a few problem, which seems harsh becuase messing up one problem means messing up the bulk of the whole test\n",
      "Super nice! And he makes the lectures easy enough to follow.\n",
      "Know's his stuff inside out, great guy, very helpful. Do your homework, and pay attention in lecture (even though he talks crazy fast), you'll be fine. He's really clear and seems passionate about Physics\n",
      "Professor Guerra is hands down the best physics professor at UCI. I am absolutely terrible at physics and I actually failed 3B so I retook it over the summer with Guerra. His teaching style is easy to follow, he posts extra lecture notes online, & he is the nicest guy ever. Do the homework problems on MP + practice & you'll be fine!\n",

      "Comments for these professors are:\n",
      "Very tough class with tons of weekly homework assignments. Exams are very difficult and mostly unexplained as they are simply online open book and open notes.\n",
      "His lectures are practically useless, reiterating the textbook while skipping crucial steps that the textbook provides to understand the content. The exams are made extremely hard because of the fact that they are online now and open book/notes. Even with open book/notes for the exams, the class average was a D-.\n",
      "The questions in exams are not covered in class or hw, so need hard self-study. Grading is very tough.\n",
      "Very stubborn, extremely by the book and thinks it's always right even when there is sufficient evidence to prove otherwise. No way you're getting accurate partial credit for the work you've done.\n",
      "very nice professor, and he is very generous in grading\n",
      "just take his class, he is a nice guy for grading. Also, he would try his best to explain theories, maybe due to classess. GPA Guardian.\n",
      "This class is really easy! He isn't the greatest lecturer, but the midterms and finals were exactly homework questions. As long as you understand those, you will do well! Even if you don't, you can count on the HUGE curve to raise your grade! Do take the class for a GPA boost!\n",
      "He will give you great curve! That is the most important thing!\n",
      "Jing Xia has extremely time consuming and mind boggling homework. However, if you do all the homework and memorize all the processes, you will be more than fine on the midterms/final because they are pretty much the homework with a change of numbers or just \"write the answer with variables\". Just do the homework well and the A will be all yours.\n",
      "His lecture is pretty easy to understand, and if you do all the homework, you will do great on midterms and final exam. He also give big curves and extra credit at the end. Great professor and highly suggested!!!:)\n",
      "His course is pretty easy to understand. If you do homework every week carefully , you will get an A, since midterms and the final heavily come from homework. He also gives lots of extra credits at the end. A very professional and kind professor. Highly suggested!\n",
      "Xia: Expert physicist with clear understanding of material, but difficulty explaining concepts. Chinese accent takes some effort to understand. Approachable and nice but not recommended for those new to physics. 7C: Self-study course, tedious but manageable webwork, midterms molded to class preference, midterms/final based on webwork, memorization.\n",
      "If you want to pass physics 7c with an A at UCI, take Prof. Xia! His midterms and final are word for word homework problems that are so simple if you practice them once or twice. Study the latest material before the given test and you'll pass. His lectures are dry but he does make the class laugh here and there and he's very approachable and nice.\n",
      "Context: I took his Physics 7C class where everyone took AP Physics except for me. Difficult accent to understand. Lectures are pretty boring as I only showed up because of participation grade. He is very fast-paced and difficult follow along in class (maybe just me?). However, his midterms were very similar to homework questions, which was good.\n",
      "a super nice professor who is generous for giving scores, simple midterm and quiz drop 2 quiz at the sametime\n",
      "Prof. Jing Xia seriously made physics easy. His tests and quizzes are VERY easy if you just do homework or memorize the hw. Our class average for each midterm were in the 90s. He actually cares about the class opinion so we essentially picked how many questions we wanted on the midterms. Also, tests are word for word homework questions!\n",
      "Honestly one of the best professors I've ever had. Very lenient on grading, and cares a lot more that you know the material than that you can take a test. Stops his lectures to make sure every student understands the questions he asks and has a very good sense of when students don't understand something. I would love to have professor Xia again.\n",
      "He posts slides online so it's not really mandatory to go to class. It seems like the TA does all the work. Midterm 1 was easy and 2 was meh, and I got rekt by final. MasteringPhysics homework is annoying, but it's not just this class. Some questions were from Mastering Physics so it's good to do it.\n",
      "This class is for Physics majors (or at least it was for Fall 2016). Two midterms, one final, and Mastering Physics homework. Material is not hard, especially to Physics students. It's just review of AP Physics 1 basically. Just make sure to understand the concept, and A is definitely achievable.\n",

      "Comments for these professors are:\n",
      "By far, the hardest professor in a subject that is already known for being difficult. On midterm, he made us derive own equations using methods never discussed in class, such as Taylor expansion. Midterm was open book (internet access as well) and the average was 10.7/20 on a Physics multiple choice test. Say goodbye to your GPA.\n",
      "Worst professor ever. Im confident he does not care about his students and wants to make them suffer. Never admits to his own mistakes and is making his class all retake an 8am 80 min midterm because he lost our names on our exams. Tells us a day before the retake midterm that we all have to take it.\n",
      "literally reads off his slides, but makes you have to attend lectures... gives quizzes on material we havent learned yet, and his excuse is that we should read his slides beforehand and ask questions if we have any on material we havent even learned yet.... Lost our midterms and so making us all retake it and gives us only 1 day in advance to study\n",
      "Poor Lecturer. reads off the slides verbatim and doesn't actually teach anything. In addition the midterm was extremely tough, and he somehow LOST THE ANSWERS so the students had to retake it again. Avoid at all costs\n",
      "Hilariously bad\n",
      "Hardest tests Ive ever taken. Full of Greek letters in the end since he DOESNT ALLOW CALCULATORS IN PHYSICS\n",
      "Each lab is run by a TA, we didn't see Dr. Molzon the whole time. Each week we have a lab, that we follow from the lab manual, and submit a written report. A lot of writing in this class, but more busy work than intellectual work. Final was only 18-20 qs and worth a lot so make sure you study for that. Overall chill lab\n",
      "You don't see Molzon, you work directly with the TA at all times, and always your lab grades are based on how tough your TA grades. Final was whatever, you need to study a alot for it, however the lab manual is really bad at explaning, so it's hard to grasp a concept even tho you took 3C.\n",
      "His lectures are him going through a slide show of done problems really quickly so that he can fill his quota of a chapter a week. He does not upload any files, we got our midterm solutions the day before the final. No practice final for us to study. The average on the midterm was a 54% without a curve. Im just glad the final class is curved.\n",
      "He is very vague with his explanations. He just reads off the slides and does not really explain anything unless you ask him. Good guy though.\n",
      "Although he is a good person to talk, he doesn't teach well. The most important point is his quizzes and tests are freaking hard. As far as I know, all my friends' midterm scores are lower than 50%. Don't take his class!!!\n",
      "Am going into his lectures right now... Just saying the textbook teaches way better than him. He doesn't teach that well and crams everything into a page on the slide. Doesn't use the mic (That's fine), but doesn't speak loudly and tends to ramble. Probably a good person, but bad professor.\n",
      "Had him for physics 18, awful professor. Everything he says he just contradicts himself, makes no sense. Tests are very difficult. Would not recommend for a General Ed class.\n",
      "This class is a hard class for a GE. I do not recommend to take. His midterm test average was extremely low. You must go to class because you get participation points with the iclicker. His lectures are hard to understand. You will be dosing off the entire town because it is hard to understand.\n",
      "Took his 52A class but never saw him. We basically work with the TAs the whole quarter, so I think the difficulty will vary by your TA. I had Likun, who was very helpful but a tough grader. Would recommend his section. Also, I just emailed Molzon 1 time this whole quarter and he never got back to me, so he just doesn't interact w the class at all.\n",
      "I took his Physics 52A (lab) and have never seen him. The TA has worked us the whole quarter. All students need to do is read the lab manual and follow its instructions. That's it!\n",
      "The entire class is conducted using only variables so it is very hard to keep track of what's going on. Not only that, he over complicates even the simplest concepts. The tests are difficult, and the website where you do the homework is not very friendly either. Unless you're great at thinking only in variables, it's best to avoid this class.\n",
      "This is one of those situations where the professor knows his subject so well that everyone else has no idea what he's talking about. Everything is taught with only variables, so its very difficult to keep up. Not only that, but he over complicates even the simplest of concepts. The website that the homework is on is unfriendly as well. Tryto Avoid\n",
      "He does everything in variables and doesn't really teach the information. He just uses a few examples to do his teaching. If you are going to take this class, make sure you know the material prior to taking it at all or you will be suffering.\n",
      "my review is biased, he gave me a job. just stay awake, pay attention, answer his questions to keep the class moving, everything is in variables so you can apply it to anything, midterm and final are the only things that matter, discussions and tutorial are helpful, just be precise. doing interesting research, helpful if your willing to work.\n",

      "lots of useless homework...\n",
      "He is an exemplary Professor who expects hard work from his students. You may face conceptual questions on exams, so be sure that you thoroughly understand class material. Lectures are helpful and he posts not only slides, but also his voice and live demonstrations. He gives plenty of resources to succeed, and he expects you to make use of them.\n",
      "Much worse than 7D and 7E, learned nothing other than how to plug numbers into hundreds of different formulas. Shouldn't be required. Lectures hardly went over example problems and had tons of unhelpful demonstrations. Lectures didn't help with HW problems but your forced to watch them. Tons of HW, most is busy work and doesn't help for final.\n",
      "Lectures are good, but some of his policies suck. Online quizzes were annoying, you must complete each question in order b4 moving on, and once you submit an answer it's final. He also refuses to provide solutions to past quizzes when asked. In summer there's about 20+ hrs of work a week, with stuff due each day which can feel overwhelming.\n",
      "Professor Collins is very thorough, he records his lectures and posts them for people to watch afterwards if they couldn't make it to class. He does demos every lecture which really help drive the topic home, and then posts the demos along with his lectures. Also, pretty funny guy :)\n",
      "Dr. Collins is an excellent teacher, and his lecture videos - though long - did well in condensing material and providing some practice. 7E is slightly less difficult than 7D, but still requires intensive studying. The homework is good practice for the final but is quite difficult. The curve is great; I got 75 on midterm and final, and A- overall.\n",
      "Video lectures were interesting, but need more examples. Physics is math based, and he doesn't prep you for the tricky/more advanced problems like on the exams. Midterm is 10%, final is 40%. The rest of the points can be gained easily, class is curved too. The material isn't too tough, literally no calculus. Phil is good, but don't take it online.\n",
      "The class is pretty difficult as excepted from the material, having it online makes it only more difficult. I felt that the videos were unclear at times and there is a large homework load. Tests are very difficult and I'd recommend having an in person lecture to learn the material easier.\n",
      "This class was incredibly easy, and showing up was 25% of my grade. It is just showing up, 3 short assignments a week (graded on effort), and midterm and final. The subject matter is interesting and easy to grasp.\n",
      "The curve is wonderful for this class! Although there's quite a bit of hw and lectures are mandatory, quizzes resemble hw and final also was not that bad!  Just watch his lectures, do hw, and you'll be fine! He's also very funny 3\n",
      "I got A or A- on every other classes, but I got a C on his class. His test are totally different from the homework, and the sample exam. He tests on concepts, but he never mentions that. However, he is a humurous teacher.\n",
      "Taking Physics 7E with Professor Collins was the biggest mistake that I've ever taken. He was truly a terrible professor that only cared about his students getting through. He went over nothing except the easiest material during lecture and made the class suffer for the homework and exams. Get a tutor, this was my first C I ever got!\n",
      "Phil was a different guy. He was pretty knowledgeable, the course was a bit odd. He quizzed us, then lectured on the material. However, most of the course's grade was very very easy. Even the final wasn't bad. Easy A.\n",
      "I took this class b/c I heard it would be an easy G.E. Wrong! The material can get pretty boring and the warm ups are kind of tedious, but the grading is kind of ridiculous. There is no partial credit on the written final and I believe the highest % in the class was around 85. Take an easier class if you need to fulfill your science category\n",
      "I am pretty interested in physics but this class just made it incredibly boring.  He dumbs down the lectures so much and spends half the class time repeating himself that it is very easy to get bored and fall asleep.There is also homework every other day. As previously mentioned, he is very rude and sarcastic in his email responses.Do not recommend\n",
      "If you don't enjoy physics, don't take the class. It's all mainly conceptual physics, difficult to understand unless you really read the book. His tests are very difficult too.\n",
      "He is a good lecturer, cool demo, only reason why i fell asleep sometimes was cuz it was right after i ate lunch :p but relatively easy to learn whether science major or not.\n",
      "Fun professor and interesting demonstrations. Make sure you read the book to answer warm-up questions and either go to class or watch his presentations online for the midterm/final.  Tests were hard but he curves alot.  2 short answers that weren't too difficult.\n",
      "Good lecturer, keeps it interesting, clear powerpoints, cool demos. Midterm and final were a bit hard but he curves them to the class average, which really helps! I got C's on both of them, yet ended up with an A in the class. And as long as you do the homework (5 questions on each chapter) and the two 2-page papers, it's easy to get a good grade.\n",
      "This was one of my easiest classes. I recommend this class to everyone. He has moved up to top 3 favorite professors at UCI. Demos are good, and has a sense of humor. His midterm was not bad, nor was his final. Just know your material.\n",

      "Don't let the reviews fool you, he's a good professor and he wants you to do well.\n",
      "I took Prof. McDubs for both 7D and 7E. If you are someone that loves problem solving this is the professor for you. His quizzes are easy if you do all of the optional homework. His tests are based solely off of the in-class experiments so you must go to lecture, take notes, and participate especially since the test are open note.\n",
      "Despite all the bad press here, Professor McWilliams was quite honestly the coolest guy for the job. His curves are very generous, as the averages across almost all assignments was a 50%. He also posts a practice midterm and final, both mimic the actual tests closely. The quizzes are based on homework and are curved well. Take him if you can.\n",
      "GO TO CLASS. LITERALLY, write down EVERYTHING he says, even the tiniest detail. Record lectures if you have to. He'll mention which problems will be on the midterm and final, so write that down. For quizzes, do the homework problems and you should be fine. Don't be afraid if you get a 40% on a test, that will be the average and curved to a B-.\n",
      "He is a very enthusiastic professor, but he lacks clarity. Going to lecture was not helpful at all. I do enjoy his demonstrations, but he never goes over practice problems. He does not prepare you well enough for quizzes or exams.\n",
      "McWilliams is a great guy and brilliant physicist; he knows his stuff. However, I've attended every lecture, read the textbook, and I still can't do the problems on his sample final. He doesn't show you how to do problems, just derives equations and expects us to understand. Quizzes and tests problems seem to come from nowhere in the book.\n",
      "He only grades using a midterm and final with four quizzes. He doesn't let you use calculators for complex calculations during quizzes, but the midterm and final are open book. The questions are based on the smallest details of lecture which test attendance, not understanding.  Makes everything more difficult than it needs to be.\n",
      "Dude al you guys don't get it. This guy is a BEAST. Would take over and over again.\n",
      "I personally think McWilliams is a great professor. It's a tough course, and you need to work for it. He's very approachable and if you pay attention to the demos and make sure to ask him what he's trying to demonstrate, it's doable and enjoyable personally.  Take GOOD notes, quantify the demos, read, and do homework problems, and it should be ok.\n",
      "McWIlliams is a great guy, but as a teacher, he is horrible. Class is literally a magic show with a whole bunch of demos. These demos are so important to doing well in the course, but he doesnt really tell us why things are happening. He doesnt explain the science. He spends a lot of time deriving equations. I just hope the curve is generous.\n",
      "Four homework quizzes worth 20% midterm 35% final 45%. tests are tough but doable. make sure to pay attention to demos. if youre struggling others are too. tests are open book and open note. \n",
      "This guy is just out of this world. I honestly feel bad for anyone who has to take him after me. Has a ridiculous grading system, 20% Quizzes, 35% Midterm, 45% Final. All his exams are based off lecture demonstrations, so be very awake at 8:00am class. His average on exams are 40-50% even though they are open booknotes. If you take him, I'm sorry!\n",
      "Some people just shouldn't teach. McWilliams is a great and practical guy but just not helpful. He lectures you about earthquakes, water conservation & car parts. He naturally assumes everyone is an engineering major & we already know everything he's saying. \"Let the physics guide you.\" He always says that, but the physics never helped my grade...\n",
      "He doesn't teach your typical physics class. Midterms and finals are based on in-class demonstrations, and be prepared to remember things about earthquakes' equations.\n",
      "Everything he tests you on is from lectures. The class is about electricity and magnetism and yet he talks about earthquakes extensively, and he actually tests us about it asking us how to find the distance between waves. He also tests in detail about specific numbers provided in the lectures where he does demonstrations.\n",
      "Honestly f this guy. He teaches the class like we know absolutely everything and are completely able to use this the world at ease. He expects us to remember all the equations and most of the constants. He is ridiculous. DO NOT TAKE.\n",
      "I really hated the way this professor taught. He tries to make his students think conceptually, and doesn't want the students to just memorize facts. I get his view; however, after attending every lecture and getting a B in the class, I honestly feel like I have leaned nothing useful about electricity or magnetism at all. Do not take his class.\n",
      "He's a pleasant guy, tries really hard to make lectures interesting with lots of demonstrations. But he is sometimes unclear about what he wants on assignments, and the exams were not very similar to any practice problems we had done before. The class could've had more focus.  In the end he curved the entire class so that everyone got ok grades.\n",
      "overall, mcwilliams is an alright professor but the exams are really difficult:/\n",

      "Comments for these professors are:\n",
      "He is amazing, best tracher in Physics. His lecture is great and help you understanding better. Midterm is a little bit of difficult but is still great!\n",
      "Summer session 1 TAs do the carrying, lectures are really not required since lecture ppts are uploaded. 7LD lab is a better substitute for his rambling lectures Homework and quizzes: correlate with each other but not to half of exams Exams: calculus heavy, and curved, final heavy in concepts grading does not match syllabus guidelines\n",
      "He was the best professor ever! Just kidding but he was still pretty great. People judge him because he has a different teaching style than others but that doesn't mean he's a bad professor. He explains Physics in actual English which is sooooo helpful compared to all the technical terms you read in the book or online. He does funny demonstrations.\n",
      "Minassian's lectures very great. He has a lot of energy and gets your attention so it was very helpful for an 8am class 4days a week. He often related topics to biology which was refreshing. I was surprised that he seemed to have a pretty good knowledge of biology, unusual for physics profs. Very nice guy and has a sense of humor which h helps\n",
      "Very good! Just ask him and he will answer you. It helps so much, especially to me.\n",
      "Brilliant guy with a sense of humor. Prof. M. really cares about students and was very generous with office hours and questions. He emphasizes understanding rather than memorization. He gave us ALL the formulas for the exams. Midterm was very fair. Final was too long but looking at the solutions, most had short calculations. Curve was very fair\n",
      "Very funny teacher, wants students to truly learn physics in his class, not memorize useless formulas. First midterm was pretty easy, final was incredibly hard but for a summer 8am class, he kept class very engaging, often asking individual students if they understood what he was saying. Had problems with pacing, we had to learn 3 chapters in 1 day\n",
      "Great teacher man the test are all fundamental physic concepts if you study these well you will get a good score on the test. He is a very inspirational teacher, he believes that hard work beats talents and practice makes perfection.\n",
      "He is caring and funny. Once I sat in the front playing my phone and he caught me, and he started to talk about how software companies manage to get people addictive to their products. Had much fun in this class.\n",
      "He's really nice and passionate. That being said, his tests and lectures aren't nice. His time management for lectures is not good and he often goes on tangents. His exams have general questions on them. It's hard to understand what to expect from his tests. If he lectured better and gave a clear criteria for grading, he would be good.\n",
      "Tbh he improved from first to second. i hope he improves more\n",
      "I did not like him after the first midterm. However, the second midterm was a GREAT improvement! Also, he gives detailed solutions to the previous midterms for review for the final! The quizzes need some more improvement though.\n",
      "Minassian's second midterm was actually much better than the first one. He does explain the concepts well and why the equations are what it is but I think more problems and exercises would be much better as well.\n",
      "OK, I have to say professor Minassian's second midterm was pretty fair and would say pretty organized. I actually finished the exam and feel confident but no grades yet. I felt bad that he was new and we gave him a hard time, but well, he learned, so it worked. He is a very knowledgeable and a decent guy. Has been very helpful during office hours.\n",
      "The midterm is not as tough as I thought compare to Mastering. But we didnt have much time to finish because he was quite a bit disorganized (probably bc this is his first quarter at UCI?). Do not need to go to lecture if you are 100% sure you will study on your own. Its not fair if u do not study and come here to blame him.\n",
      "A respected professor here at UCI, extremely tough with midterms/quizzes however. Does not deserve all the hate, is more than generous with his curve and extra credit oppportunities. Drops the lowest quiz/hw/midterm which really helps. Although his midterm was extremely tough and we only had half an hour to do it, a solid professor here at UCI\n",
      "You definitely won't pass if you skip class, but there's a really high chance that you won't pass even if you go! Just prepare to fail if you get him!\n",
      "I felt a bit encouraged during the midterm because he came to it as prepared as the students were.\n",
      "Minassian doesn't deserve all the backlash he's getting tbh, he's human, he makes mistakes, ok. However, midterm and quizzes are trash. My biggest disappointment is the HW. The deadline changes unannounced and I've already missed 3 assignments just from that. I already bombed the midterm and quizzes, missing HW points is just the final blow.\n",
      "Although Minassian is a good person, I have to say that he is a terrible professor. He often goes on tangents in lecture and because of this I completely stopped going to his lectures. Also his midterm was trash! He said that midterm was going to based on the disscusion, the mastering physics, and the hw, but surprise, none of that was on there. :(\n",

      "Dr. Bullock is a great physicist and, admittedly, a total hunk. His lectures are clear and engaging, and he strives to make cosmology understandable to all students. His class is a chill GE, with two easy multiple choice midterms and a final. He posts his lectures, and homework is good practice for exams. A lovely guy and a great class!\n",
      "So great! He was super nice & engaging w/ the class, also pretty funny. His lectures are easy to follow, makes things easy to understand & allows you to ask questions online anonymously in class which I thought was a great. 2 midterms & 1final - all multiple choice, they arent hard  if you do a review of the notes. Definitely would take him again!\n",
      "Wonderful and passionate professor. It's obvious he cares about his students and loves teaching Cosmology. I learned a lot in this class and the class is very near stress-free. One of the best professors I've had and my favorite course at UCI!\n",
      "Amazing and funny prof that's really passionate and knowledgeable on the subject. He made learning about Cosmology fascinating and cares about the success of his students. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Easy HW and amazing lectures (don't miss out!). There were 2 midterms and 1 final all lecture based so make sure to know concepts.\n",
      "Discussions are not mandatory. Grade consists of Midterms and a final. Easy class, do not have to go to lectures, but they are helpful, he posts the lectures on a website. No need to buy a book, just pay a one time fee for his website (where he posts lectures and hwks).\n",
      "2 midterms and a paper compose the majority of the grade. You dont need a textbook but you have to pay $20 to enroll in an online program to do the homework. It was all honestly super easy, he understands that literally nobody cares because it's just a GE. He's super funny, I would pounce on an opportunity to take another class with him.\n",
      "Easy class, the online components are helpful and he gives great lectures. Very passionate. Two midterms and a one page paper make up most of the grade. Extra credit comes from tweeting at him on twitter. Very interesting subject. Stay on top of the work and you'll be fine.\n",
      "Amazing lecturer. If you go to and listen to his lectures, you can get an A.\n",
      "Very interesting and passionate about his subject. He's a very chill professor. 2 midterms and 1 final all MC. Extra credit just by asking questions on twitter. 10/10 would take again\n",
      "He's awesome, funny, and very friendly. I am doing research with him outside of class and he is just the best.\n",
      "Amazing lecturer but this was his first time teaching 7D , so he made the test harder than usual. E and M is hard by itself but he made it bearable\n",
      "His lectures are great - extremely clear and entertaining. He often posts lectures online! Also, he is exceptionally good looking so that doesn't make things too bad either. Loved this class!!!!!\n",
      "I actually really enjoyed this class! The topic is interesting, and Professor Bullock knows it's a GE course so it's pretty laid back. Just know the PowerPoints for the midterms and homework. Also he's hot, so that's a plus!\n",
      "This class was amazing! The professor is great, and I looked forward to this class every time.\n",
      "Great professor! Passionate about what he's teaching. Material was very interestingfun to learn about. Lecture videos are all posted online which was very helpful--some of the stuff he explains isn't on the slides. Study guides are OK, they're very vague yet the midterms were pretty detailed. And yes, he is beautiful. Wow\n",
      "Super easy! He was great at explaining and made the topic interesting. I think this was his first time teaching that course but he did great. I would recommend this course for GE.\n",
      "AMAZING!! Really easy and really interesting. I learned a lot. His midterms are super easy! &no final!! oh and he's hot\n",
      "Super awesome class!! Loved it!! It made the cosmos seem so much more interesting!! Easy midterm, easy final! just follow the powerpoint and you'll get an A.\n",
      "Great Prof and great class! Completely recommend this. A very good GE to take, mainly because the course work is light and the lecture's are interesting. He's really easy on the eyes too. Loves to engage the class and is very passionate about his work. All of lectures slides and pod casts are online. Just study the study guides and you'll be fine.\n",
      "I loved this class! The subject itself was interesting. The professor is very attractive and reminds me of Anderson Cooper. He gives a study guide (most answers are on this) for the midterm and final and 2 easy hw assignments. Lectures are posted online. I would highly recommend.\n",

Exams are fair and the workload is manageable if you're on top of your studying (daily quizzes and weekly homeworks).\n",

Labs, readings, quizzes, homework, graded in class actives, take home exams, in class exams. If you are taking a heavy course load, it will amplify your work load.\n",
      "Labs always felt rushed to finish assignments we didn't even know how to start. Felt lost on a lot of the HW assignments. Not that bad first half, got way harder second half. Expected us to get down stats concepts and how to do them in R at the same time. Go to office hours.\n",

      "Animal Sensing & Locomotion or Biomechanics was probably the hardest class I've taken at UCI. Although the course is extremely challenging, the class has given me an interest in biomechanics & physiology. Advice: find a group to work on the weekly practice quizzes, always ask questions, review your calculus/trig/physics (highly suggested).\n",
      "Grade is based on weekly quizzes. The weekly quizzes are based on the problem sets released 7 days before the weekly quizzes. To complete the problem sets, all the information comes from the lecture. Lecture was very important. The problem sets are quite hard; find a group to work with. Azizi is very passionate and explains easily. Review all math.\n",
      "Lectures are meaningless. Do not take this class at all.  The professors know what they are talking about but by no means make the class interesting. Office hours are a must and it sucks because they were all on the same day where I could not attend. Weekly quizzes, no midterm or final. Must memorize complex problems.\n",
      "Probably the best professor at UCI.  Knowledgable. Well spoken. Always willing to help. WAY better than German, he should teach the class alone.   Podcasts are available. Curve is supposed to be generous. Go to OH\n",
      "He is AWESOME! So helpful & clear! Loveeeeeeed him!\n",
      "Hands down one of my fav professors (german being the other). he teaches the class in such an engaging manner, and his explanations are crystal clear. He's pretty funny and SO helpful during office hours. Didn't really use the book, just CRUCIALLY UNDERSTAND THE LECTURES! This is not a memorization class, you have to def think on the tests!!!\n",
      "He is the best! Tests can be kinda tricky but it shouldn't be a problem if you know the material. Probably one of my favorite professors at UCI!\n",
      "He is awesome, one of the best professors at UCI. His lectures are very organized, and he is very clear, the tests are not easy but fair. Wish UCI had more professors like Prof Azizi.\n",
      "Amazing professor, one of the best at UCI. Very clear and helpful, easy to approach with questions. Not just a memorization class, must learn concepts and understand material to do well. Highly recommend taking this professor.\n",
      "Possibly my favorite professor at UCI. He's very clear in his explanations and his voice is so soothing! I always went back to listen to his lectures at least once (everything is podcasted). Go to lecture, pay attention. I absolutely loved this class and learned so much. Exams are not easy, but very fair. Take him!!!\n",
      "Lecture slides are mostly diagrams and pictures, so you need to take extra notes to get all the material. He does post lecture audios which are very helpful. Tests are multiple choice and aren't that long, so it takes more effort to get an A. Studying requires a lot of memorizing and concept understanding, but there are posted study guides to help\n",
      "I don't know why there existed no rating for this young professor. E109 was amazing, challenging, and delicious.\n",
